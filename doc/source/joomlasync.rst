joomlasync - Sync between teknolog.fi and the members registry
===============================================================

Running joomlasync on Hugin performs a sync of contact information.

The script outputs which users aren't found in teh members registry.

There's one bug which causes the program to crash when there's many users with the same username in the members registry.
