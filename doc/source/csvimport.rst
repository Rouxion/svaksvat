Import data from CSV-file
========================


You can easily export spreadsheets and databases to CSV-files, which are
easily parsed and imported to the database. A GUI would make this process safe
and easy.

Proposed features:

* Choose separator
* Choose which tables and fields correspond to which value

    * Maybe two sliders per column, one for the table and one for the field

        * Not so intuitive, but giving a long list of fieldnames is neither 
          usable

* Choose which range of lines to import

Notes:

Python does include a csv parsing module named "csv".
